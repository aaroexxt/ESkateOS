# ESkateOS
ESkateOS was made to control my custom electric skateboard, which has gone through many revisions over the years. I designed it to be a fairly robust but extensible program that can be used to safely and reliably transmit both state and throttle information over a 2.4GHz link, even with cheap radio modules (I'm using the NRF24L01+).

# Eventual Updates
This repo is missing most of the modern work I've done, like creating custom PCBs for the skateboard control instead of perfboard stuff, and I'll update it eventually :)
